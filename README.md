# Kalikro - Simplifying Complex Texts
*Hack.her.it #6 - Finalist*

## Overview
Kalikro is a functional prototype developed during Hack.her.it #6, aiming to enhance user comprehension of complex text. This project consists of both a Chrome extension and a corresponding website. The Chrome extension allows users to select text directly from their browser, and the website provides an alternative option for users to copy and paste text for simplification. The processed text is sent to our server, where it undergoes simplification, and the user is then presented with a more accessible version.

## Features
- **Chrome Extension Integration:** Seamlessly select and simplify text directly from your browser using the Kalikro Chrome extension.
- **Web Interface:** Users can also visit the Kalikro website to input text manually, offering an alternative method for text simplification.
- **Server Processing:** The selected or input text is sent to our server for processing, where it undergoes simplification to improve user comprehension.
- **Immediate Results:** Receive simplified text results in real-time, making it convenient for users to quickly understand complex content.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:** Core programming language for both the Chrome extension and the website.
- **Chrome Extension API:** Leveraged to integrate Kalikro seamlessly with the user's browser.
- **Python:** Core programming language for backend computations
